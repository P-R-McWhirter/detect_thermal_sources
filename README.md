# detect_thermal_sources
Python scripts using openCV to perform Gaussian adaptive thresholds to draw boxes around bright thermal sources in thermal images.

Depending on the function it will draw the accepted and rejected proposed boxes onto the image or alternatively, it will output the boxes (regions of interest, RoIs) into a subfolder with no output display.
